2000/05/01	As magazines sometimes do, George set a different cover on the issue sent to subscribers. The cover article -- ''Will the Biggest Liar Win?'' -- argues that Al Gore and George W. Bush have distorted the truth and is not likely to land the magazine on ''60 Minutes.'' 
2000/05/01	During my years in public office, one issue I got the most mail about was my hair, with questions like, ''How do you wear your hair when you're dressed up?'' I was urged to dye my hair, and people even enclosed checks to pay for a makeover. In no audience I've ever spoken to have I found a man who sent Al Gore a check for Rogaine or asked Newt Gingrich to get a haircut. I would have hoped that we could have erased such differences by the dawn of the 21st century. But now, it seems, the only way to imagine a woman in the White House is to put Barbie there. I'm sorry, but I just can't get enthusiastic. I can see my hero, Eleanor Roosevelt, sitting in heaven, shaking her head and saying, ''They still don't get it!'' 
2000/05/01	The remarks proved embarrassing to Gov. George W. Bush, who has been running from one photo-op to another, posing relentlessly with black and brown children and teenagers, trying to show that he and his party are not the mortal enemies of ethnic minorities. (The governor's task is not an easy one when you consider that Ronald Reagan chose to kick off his 1980 general election campaign in Philadelphia, Miss., which is where the civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney were murdered, and that the governor's own father, George Herbert Walker Bush, pumped up his win over Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race with the loathsome Willie Horton ads.) Which might have been fine except for the fact that Dr. Archer, a gynecologist, has said so much crazy stuff in the past. In the early 1990's, Dr. Archer was a deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where he served as the Bush administration's point person on the so-called gag rule, the regulation that barred doctors at federally financed family planning clinics from discussing abortion with women. 
2000/05/01	Following are excerpts from remarks prepared for delivery yesterday by Vice President Al Gore to the International Press Institute in Boston, as provided by the Gore campaign: From what we can tell of his foreign policy, Governor Bush does not prepare us to meet the grand challenges of both the classic and new security agendas. . . . Governor Bush dangerously fixates on the cold war past when speaking of the use of force. He suggests that he would not intervene to relieve even the brutal repression of ethnic cleansing and genocide. No wonder it took him six weeks to say anything about our action against the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Is that the right message for America to send to people around the globe struggling for freedom? Stuck in a cold war mindset, Governor Bush continues to view Russia and China primarily as present or future enemies. While we must remain vigilant against any deterioration in our relationships, the reality of the global age is that Russia and China are indeed competitors, but also vital partners in our efforts to tackle problems menacing to us all. Just this past week, Governor Bush used his brief meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov to issue a warning that his intention would be to build and deploy a global Star Wars system that he believes could defend the U.S. and all our allies against any missile launch from any source. In the 1990's, most serious analysts took a look at the implausibility of this endeavor, the fantastical price that our taxpayers would be expected to pay, and the dangerously destabilizing consequences of traveling down that path and rejected this notion. Governor Bush wishes to return to it, and chose the worst possible venue in which to launch -- for lack of a better phrase -- his risky foreign policy scheme. . . . When it comes to the challenges of the new security agenda, Governor Bush's foreign policy is noticeably blank. Although Africa represents a vast untapped market, has major health and environmental concerns that directly impact us, and the reaches of modern terrorism took American lives in two of our embassies on that continent, Governor Bush said that Africa ''doesn't fit into the national strategic interests.'' Is that a responsible assessment of our national interest? One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership. Since 1994, the Republicans in Congress have recklessly tossed aside decades of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy. Governor Bush joined with the isolationist, partisan Republican majority in Congress in opposing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He chose politics over principle. . . . 
2000/05/01	Here's evidence that we're getting traction: President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have detected the growing political appeal of personal privacy in a time of data rape. To a commencement audience yesterday, Clinton unveiled his plan to repel the invaders, challenging the Republican Congress to get on with legislation to stem the tide of snooping. Up to now, the Clinton-Gore record has been troubling to civil libertarians; under the rubric of searching for ''deadbeat dads,'' this administration now forces private employers to inform on workers to federal bureaucrats as never before. But Clinton's belated concern about penetrations of our privacy by marketers and e-snoops, often in support of legislation already in work, is welcome. What about sharing financial data having nothing to do with medical records? Here the Clinton-Gore plan caves in to the secret salesmen. ''We will preserve financial firms' ability to share the information that they need,'' goes the administration proposal, ''to develop new products and manage their risks . . .'' No bank is required to obtain depositor's consent; it's up to the individual to ''opt out'' -- to take the difficult initiative of demanding that the bank not make his life an open book. 
2000/05/01	Mr. Lott is reportedly offering a half-dozen federal judges for approval by the Senate in return for Democratic cooperation on Mr. Smith. Mr. Lott regards the offer as magnanimous. It is in fact insulting. For several years, he and other Republicans have thrown up one road block after another to President Clinton's judicial appointments -- a partisan debasing of the honored principle under which the Senate advises and consents on presidential nominations. This year he has allowed confirmation of only seven judges. When the tables were turned in 1992, also a hotly contested election year, a Democratic-controlled Senate was serious enough about its responsibilities to approve 66 judges nominated by President George Bush, a Republican. 
2000/05/01	There was a strong political subtext to the day. Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian organization, told the audience, ''We must elect Al Gore as president of the United States,'' arguing that ''the very future of the U.S. Supreme Court for the next generation hangs in the balance.'' Ms. Birch said of Gov. George W. Bush's position on gay rights issues: ''There is absolutely nothing about these policies that is compassionate.'' Vice President Gore, addressing the group by videotape beamed on a huge screen above the Mall, declared, ''I stand with you, and am with you every step of the way'' in the march for civil rights. Mr. Gore said he would not rest in the fight against AIDS and in the struggle to protect gay Americans from employment discrimination and to ensure that ''crimes of hate against all people, including gays and lesbians,'' are severely punished. 
2000/05/01	Gov. George W. Bush plans to push soon for a fundamental overhaul of Social Security, reopening an issue that could be among the most combustible and bitterly debated of the presidential campaign. In the next month, his aides said, Mr. Bush intends to begin pressing his case for the establishment of individual investment accounts within Social Security, a change that would be the most far-reaching to the program since it was established during the Depression. Mr. Bush believes that the accounts, which would allow workers to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock and bond markets, are an essential component of any plan to ensure the retirement system's long-term viability, his advisers said. Private accounts would allow workers to capture some of the historically high returns offered by Wall Street over the long run, thereby reducing the need to close a looming shortfall in Social Security's finances through benefit cuts or higher taxes, Mr. Bush's aides said. ''People have an understanding of how markets work, and are used to securing a higher return on their savings,'' said one adviser to Mr. Bush. ''The debate on Social Security will be joined in a way that we believe will be open to new ideas.'' Yet to most Democrats, including Vice President Al Gore, creating individual investment accounts is tantamount to abandoning Social Security's role as the provider of a guaranteed benefit for the elderly. Mr. Gore's aides said they would portray Mr. Bush's approach as too risky for many individuals because it would leave their retirement security exposed to the ups and downs of the stock market. They expect that argument to have particular resonance if Wall Street remains as volatile as it has been in recent months. Mr. Gore's team also intends to make a case that establishing personal accounts would have a huge economic cost because it would require using the portion of the projected federal budget surplus that would otherwise go to reducing and eventually eliminating the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public. Mr. Gore has made eliminating the public debt the centerpiece of his economic agenda, saying that to do so would push interest rates down and give the entire economy a boost. The vice president backs a plan that would leave Social Security intact but would extend its solvency to 2050 by allocating interest savings from the reduction in the national debt to the retirement system. ''One of the reasons Social Security has been so successful is that it's a social compact between generations, one generation taking care of the next generation,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman. ''To play around with privatizing it, when in fact there's no need to privatize it, will only lead to bad results.'' Mr. Bush plans to give a major speech on Social Security sometime in May, and to press the issue from then on, his aides said. He will not offer a detailed plan, but rather will commit himself to a set of principles that he would use as the basis for bipartisan negotiations if he was elected president. Those principles start with the establishment of private accounts. Mr. Bush will probably not specify what portion of a worker's payroll taxes could go into the accounts, but he is leaning toward making participation in the accounts voluntary, his advisers said. Under this approach, a portion of the retirement benefit would be guaranteed and a portion would fluctuate with the performance of the investment account. As the system stands now, payroll taxes on today's workers go to pay benefits for current retirees. Mr. Bush's plan would start shifting Social Security toward a system in which each worker saved something for his or her own retirement. ''The key is going to be augmenting the current pay-as-you-go system with a prefunded system based on personal accounts,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the Bush campaign's chief economic adviser. Mr. Bush will also pledge not to increase payroll taxes, and not to reduce benefits for anyone in or nearing retirement. He has left open whether the retirement age, which is already rising gradually to 67 from 65, might eventually need to be increased again. Most of the privatization proposals put on the table in the last few years envision about two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax paid by each worker being channeled into individual accounts. Privately, Mr. Bush's aides say they envision a plan of roughly the same scale. Under Mr. Gore's plan, all of the Social Security surplus would go to reducing the national debt held by the public. Mr. Bush's approach would almost certainly have to forgo large-scale reduction in the public debt. But because Mr. Bush's plan would give workers their own retirement accounts, it would decrease the government's long-term obligation to pay benefits out of tax revenues, which is another form of debt reduction. Those states, and other crucial battlegrounds like Florida, have high proportions of older voters, who in the past could have been counted on to react strongly against any major changes to Social Security. Democrats remain confident that Mr. Bush's proposal will help drive older voters to Mr. Gore, but Republican strategists said that assumption might prove outdated. ''The question that this election cycle will test,'' said one adviser to Mr. Bush, ''is whether times have changed enough through the emergence of a new investor class, and through the recognition that Social Security is going broke, that new solutions can be found.'' The adviser said that neither party could be sure of the answer. Still, the issue is likely to help Democrats mobilize their traditional constituencies. In particular, Democrats said any push by Mr. Bush to privatize Social Security would be met by stiff resistance from labor unions. 
2000/05/01	The top foreign policy adviser for Gov. George W. Bush argued today that Vice President Al Gore had misrepresented Mr. Bush's views on how to deal with Russia and China and had taken ''a series of positions that are at complete odds with how he has acted for the past seven years.'' In a telephone conversation with reporters, Mr. Bush's adviser, Condoleezza Rice, offered a response to a speech by Mr. Gore that, while reported in newspapers today, had not yet been delivered. Based on the advance text of the speech, Ms. Rice said Mr. Gore had glossed over the Clinton administration's cuts in military procurement and had ignored his involvement in a largely failed effort to convert Russia to capitalism. She was particularly critical of  Mr. Gore's sometimes meandering commitment to free trade. ''Where was he when it was time to stand up and be counted in Seattle?'' she asked, talking about the meeting of the World Trade Organization in December that was disrupted by violent protests, and where an administration effort to start a new round of global trade talks had collapsed. Mr. Gore stayed away from the meeting, partly to avoid angering union members who were demonstrating. President Clinton attended the session for a day and a half. Mr. Gore offered his strongest endorsement yet of the China trade pact in a speech in Boston today,  saying he would work to win votes for its approval, even if it meant angering his labor constituency. But Ms. Rice was not impressed. ''It's about time,'' she said. ''The vote's in three weeks.'' The exchange was particularly notable because foreign policy has played only a bit role in the presidential campaign. Mr. Bush has delivered one major speech on the subject, devoted almost entirely to security issues. That left him vulnerable to Mr. Gore's assertion today that the Texas governor ''dangerously fixates on the cold war past'' but has not dealt with the major issues of economic globalization that form some of the toughest foreign policy challenges. Ms. Rice, who was a Russia specialist on the National Security Council in President George Bush's administration, said Governor Bush was planning a series of foreign policy speeches, starting with trade. But she said that the timing of those speeches had not been set. In her critique of Mr. Gore's speech, Ms. Rice said she was particularly mystified about why he raised the issue of Russia. ''The vice president himself oversaw Gore-Chernomyrdin,'' she said, referring to meetings between Mr. Gore and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, on issues that included security and economic transformation. ''At the time it was very clear that Chernomyrdin and others who the vice president was calling 'reformers' were stealing the country blind, with the money going into Swiss bank accounts.'' The essence of Mr. Gore's critique today was that Mr. Bush was aligned with right-wing Republicans and regarded both Russia and China as ''future enemies'' rather than partners and competitors. Ms. Rice argued that Mr. Gore had deliberately misstated Mr. Bush's views, incorrectly casting him as a cold warrior and an isolationist. ''The interests of the U.S. are served by engagement with Russia and China,'' she said, ''but you have to engage them in a realistic way, not a romantic one.'' ''I would not call either country a threat, but both are challenges,'' she said, using terminology close to Mr. Gore's. She said Mr. Gore had mischaracterized Mr. Bush's views on missile defenses, an area of dispute with Russia. She enlisted Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a mainstream Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, to declare that Mr. Gore's speech was a compendium of foreign policy problems ''rather than a strategic vision.'' She also said Mr. Gore had participated in decisions to ''cut military procurement by 13 percent'' since the beginning of the Clinton administration. 
2000/05/01	Bush to Press Case For Social Security Change  Gov. George W. Bush intends to begin pressing his case for the establishment of individual investment accounts within Social Security, a change that would be the most far-reaching to the program since it was established in the Depression. Gore Attacks Bush  Vice President Al Gore, in a major foreign policy speech in Boston, attacked Gov. George W. Bush in a classic incumbent strategy, one made especially classic by Governor Bush's father, then the vice president, against another sitting governor in 1988. Bush Camp Fires Back  The top foreign policy adviser of Gov. George W. Bush, in response to the Gore speech, said that Vice President Al Gore had misrepresented Mr. Bush's views on how to deal with Russia and China and had taken ''a series of positions that are at complete odds with how he has acted for the past seven years.'' 
2000/05/01	Forget Hillary and Rudy. Never mind George W. and Al Gore. For political insiders from here to Albany, the race to watch right now is a special election for a seat on the Nassau County Legislature. 
2000/05/01	With a fullblown attack today on Gov. George W. Bush over foreign policy, Vice President Al Gore seemed to be executing a classic incumbent strategy, one made especially classic by Governor Bush's father, then the vice president, against another sitting governor in 1988. The Gore campaign has been sifting through the detritus of the elder Mr. Bush's steamrolling of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts and has unearthed useful lessons. Those lessons, for an incumbent vice president defending a relatively popular administration against a sitting governor, are becoming increasingly evident. The basic thrust: try to hamstring the opponent by raising questions about his record and his readiness to be president. Neither the Gore campaign nor the Bush campaign particularly likes the analogy. The Gore team says it is having a high-minded policy debate and is not employing negative personal attacks. The Bush campaign says Mr. Gore, unlike Vice President George Bush in 1988, is misrepresenting the governor's record. Their routes may be different, but the Gore campaign arrives at the same place Governor Bush's father arrived a dozen years ago. They both present a sitting vice president as the responsible steward of the current peace and prosperity. And they both cast the challenger as risky and irresponsible and his state as an alien universe that is culturally out of the mainstream. Already, Texas has been portrayed as such an aberration that it almost resembles, well, Massachusetts in 1988. Governor Bush began this campaign much the way Governor Dukakis began his, as the respected if little-known executive of a state that had appeared to make strides economically and socially. Part of this was Mr. Dukakis's  fault. He did not think Vice President Bush's attacks were worth answering. And he slapped on a helmet and climbed into a battle tank, providing perhaps the most enduring, if hapless, image of his campaign. This time around, Mr. Gore's chief criticism of Mr. Bush was initially confined to the governor's ''risky tax scheme.'' But he has ratcheted up that criticism every day. Now the word ''risky,'' supplemented by ''irresponsible'' and ''reckless,'' is applied to the entire Bush world view. The risky tax scheme begets a risky economic plan, which encompasses risky health and education plans and so on. So in a major foreign policy speech in Boston today, Mr. Gore criticized Mr. Bush for talking about a costly and controversial Star Wars missile defense plan in his meeting with the foreign minister of Russia and said the Texan ''chose the worst possible venue in which to launch -- for lack of a better phrase -- his risky foreign policy scheme.'' On the domestic policy front, Mr. Gore has portrayed Mr. Bush's Texas as a backwater with substandard education and inadequate health insurance and its residents as so gun-happy that the governor signed a bill allowing them to take weapons into churches. Further, Mr. Gore likes to link Governor Bush with the ''failed'' policies of his father and refers often to ''the Bush-Quayle recession.'' Today Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush was ''stuck in a cold war mindset'' and that he would have to fill in the ''gaps'' in his knowledge of foreign policy with the right-wing isolationist ideology of Congressional Republicans like Senator Jesse Helms. But if Mr. Gore has learned from the 1988 campaign, so has Governor Bush. Instead of allowing Mr. Gore to define him the way Vice President Bush defined Governor Dukakis, Governor Bush has tried to the avoid the extremist conservative box Mr. Gore has tried to put him in. Governor Bush has spent much time reaching for the political center, especially on issues like education and health care, which have traditionally been viewed as more favorable to Democrats. And he has emphasized bipartisanship and his ability to work with Democrats. Governor Bush has also been quicker to respond to attacks than was Governor Dukakis. Unlike Mr. Dukakis, Governor Bush is not only resisting Mr. Gore's caricature of him but is constructing his own caricature of Mr. Gore, as the candidate who does not tell the truth and is bent on a campaign of destruction. The constant refrain from the Bush campaign is that Mr. Gore ''will say anything to get elected.'' Mr. Gore has pushed away any suggestion that he is being negative, saying he believes the country wants a healthy debate on the issues people care about. He has already signaled what some of those issues will be and how he intends to use them, as in recent days, when he excoriated Mr. Bush's record on the environment by calling Texas the most polluted state in the country, citing Houston's chronic air pollution as an example. And while some in the Gore campaign have been studying the 1988 campaign -- its similarities include an incumbent vice president who began the campaign in double digits behind a governor -- his spokesman rejects the idea that the 1988 Bush campaign is any kind of model. ''We're putting out our positive vision,'' said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore. ''The difference is that in 1988, Bush's goal was to pull down Dukakis.'' It was in this long tradition that Vice President Gore's first television commercial, once he secured the nomination, said to viewers: ''Al Gore is ready. Is George W.?'' 
2000/05/02	I am offended that Elizabeth Birch of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay group, saw fit to speak on behalf of the movement when she said ''we must elect Al Gore as president of the United States'' (news article, May 1). It may shock Ms. Birch, but lots of gays oppose Mr. Gore and resent being taken for granted by the Democratic Party. Like the millions of ordinary Americans of all backgrounds, we middle-of-the-road gays are still outraged by the scandals and immorality of the present administration, and we yearn for a return to decency, honesty and virtue in the White House. If that means voting for George W. Bush, so be it. We are savvy enough to balance our commitment to equal rights for gays with our commitment to the country's values and integrity. 
2000/05/02	Re ''What a Texas Record Can't Tell'' (Op-Ed, April 28): Paul Burka is trying to get across the point that Gov. George W. Bush should not and cannot be blamed for most of the social problems and deficiencies that Texas has because that conservative state has long-held restraints on what its governors can accomplish politically. My question is, if Governor Bush has accomplished little as Texas's chief executive, how is he qualified to serve as president of the United States? Basically, he is running without any track record. Perhaps if his name weren't Bush, he would just be one of the also-rans who took part in this year's Republican primaries. 
2000/05/02	Gov. George W. Bush can only hope that his meeting next week with Senator John McCain goes as well as Mr. McCain's meeting with Vice President Al Gore. Mr. McCain met on Sunday for about 20 minutes with Mr. Gore at the Naval Observatory in Washington, the vice president's official residence. Both were appearing on CNN's ''Late Edition,'' which was being filmed at the residence. When Mr. Gore learned on Saturday that Mr. McCain would be under his own roof on Sunday, he called the Arizona senator and invited him to come over early for a private chat. ''We're friends,'' Mr. Gore told reporters later, noting that the two had served in the House and Senate together. ''It's not that complicated.'' He said he understood that Mr. McCain, who has suspended his own presidential campaign, would be endorsing Mr. Bush, a fellow Republican, for president. But ever since Mr. Gore locked up the Democratic nomination, he has been invoking Mr. McCain's name and making an overt play for his independent-minded supporters. On Sunday night, Mr. Gore seemed eager to fill reporters in on the details of their get-together, uncharacteristically allowing camera crews to film him on his airplane discussing the matter as he flew from Boston to Washington. Mr. Gore said the two discussed campaign finance reform, Mr. McCain's signature issue and one that Mr. Gore is advancing in his campaign. Mr. Gore has said the McCain-Feingold proposal to eliminate so-called soft money from campaigns would be his No. 1 domestic initiative, a move some critics suspect is an effort to inoculate himself against criticism that his own fund-raising has been too aggressive. The Sunday session thus struck some as an effort by Mr. Gore to bask in Mr. McCain's credibility on the issue, or what the political columnist Mark Shields calls ''innocence by association.'' The vice president also wanted to signal that he could work with Republicans, a theme that Mr. Bush has emphasized recently while suggesting that Mr. Gore was excessively partisan. ''I will regularly and routinely reach across party lines,'' Mr. Gore said on Sunday night, adding that his ''natural instincts'' were to work in a bipartisan manner. Mr. Gore went even further in this direction by suggesting, in answer to a question, that he might even name a Republican as his vice president. ''I think that's unlikely,'' he said, but ''I would not rule it out.'' While the cameras were still rolling, Mr. Gore also poked fun at his own comments about the Elian Gonzalez case, which has caused him much political heartache. But the biggest laugh came when Mr. Gore referred to a ''bit part'' that he had played in a well-received video that President Clinton had made to show at the annual White House correspondents' dinner on Saturday night. A reporter on the plane remembered that Mr. Gore had made a brief appearance in the video but said, ''I've forgotten what it was,'' inadvertently summarizing Mr. Gore's longtime difficulty in establishing himself outside Mr. Clinton's shadow. 
2000/05/02	Administration officials used the news to strengthen their claim to being a force for fiscal prudence and the guardian of economic expansion. They sought to contrast their focus on debt reduction to calls from Republicans, who have a majority in Congress, and from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, for big tax cuts. 
2000/05/02	Microsoft says it has lobbied both likely presidential nominees, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, to influence their views of the case and to counter lobbying by its competitors. Mr. Bush has made a few unspecific comments about the case sympathetic to Microsoft, while Mr. Gore has declined to discuss it. 
2000/05/02	RUBIN PLAYS DOWN SPOT ON TICKET  Former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, one of many prominent Democrats mentioned as a potential running mate for Vice President Al Gore, seemed to reject the idea yesterday, calling it ''a curious notion.'' Discussing economic policy and what he saw as key issues in the campaign, Mr. Rubin said that while he has been around politics for many years, including a stint as a Democratic fund-raiser, he viewed running for and serving in office as a special field, ''something unto itself.'' Mr. Rubin suggested that it was unwise to choose a nominee who had not been tested by other campaigns. ''I have never run for office,'' he said. ''You don't want somebody in a presidential campaign, which is the ultimate of political experience in this country, who hasn't been tested by running before.'' Mr. Rubin spoke on Political Points, the Webcast of The New York Times and ABC News. NADER COURTS AUTO WORKERS  The consumer advocate and Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader discussed an endorsement yesterday with leaders of the United Automobile Workers in Detroit. Mr. Nader said that he did not directly ask for an endorsement and that the union would not endorse a candidate until after a Congressional vote, scheduled for late May, on establishing permanent normal trade relations with China. Mr. Nader, the auto workers and other major unions oppose the bill. Instead of asking for endorsements, Mr. Nader said: ''I just tell people what we're doing.'' Union officials were unavailable for comment. The union, which has criticized President Clinton's trade policies, broke with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in October, when the labor federation endorsed Vice President Al Gore. 
2000/05/02	Maybe the only thing to do is go national. Next time Al Gore or George Bush comes to your town, ask him what he'd do to crack down on hog lagoons. One of them might have an answer, and at least it might liven things up. 
2000/05/02	McCain-Gore Meeting  Senator John McCain and Vice President Al Gore met for 20 minutes on Sunday. Mr. Gore said they discussed changing campaign financing, Mr. McCain's signature issue and one that Mr. Gore is also advancing. Mr. McCain is to meet with Gov. George W. Bush next week. 
2000/05/02	Last week, for example, the Republican National Committee brought in $21.3 million -- the most ever raised in a single event -- at its  gala in Washington saluting the party's apparent presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush. The Republicans received six-figure contributions -- and fund-raising assistance -- from Philip Morris, AT&T and the National Rifle Association, all three of which are among the most generous soft-money contributors to the party this year. The Democrats hope  to raise a similar amount at a tribute to President Clinton later this month. 
2000/05/03	The title of Edmund Wilson's book on Civil War writings, ''Patriotic Gore,'' is an apt phrase for Mr. Bradley's work. As a reconstruction of one of the bloodiest battles of World War II, ''Flags of Our Fathers'' is straightforwardly patriotic. There is no historical revisionism here; in Mr. Bradley's vision, the Americans are the good guys, and the Japanese enemy, while brave, is ruthless and unspeakably cruel. 
2000/05/03	Mr. Stewart declined through a spokeswoman to comment on the charges yesterday. The spokeswoman, Kelly Bush, said that Mr. Stewart had not yet been notified of the action. Mr. Stewart said that before he made the speech, he alerted Mr. Miller; the play's director, David Esbjornson; Ms. Bush; and the rest of the cast. The actors declined through a secret ballot to join Mr. Stewart onstage. 
2000/05/03	Bill East was greatly underestimated by the old guard, George Bush and Bob Dole. He upended them and became, heaven help us, the poster boy for his generation, dominating the 90's. His rise was relentless, leaving a trail of enemies behind, using any means at his disposal to rule. 
2000/05/03	Late last year Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and other foes of the McCain-Feingold bill that would ban the unlimited donations to political parties known as soft money never tired of saying that this was an issue of little interest to American voters. Then the reform cause was energized by Senator John McCain's primary campaign, and by a Democratic race in which Vice President Al Gore declared that enactment of the soft-money ban would be one of his highest priorities as president. Unfortunately, Gov. George W. Bush has so far joined Mr. Lott as an obstacle to reform. He says he favors a ban on corporation and union contributions to parties, but he would leave open a wide loophole by allowing unlimited donations to parties from individuals. Like other opponents of reform, he calls it a free speech issue. But Congress set limits on individual donations to candidates in 1974 after the Watergate scandals, and the legislation before Congress would simply extend those limits to donations to parties, which have been used to undermine the old reforms. Mr. McCain is to meet with the presumptive party nominee in a few days to talk about issues. He needs to press Mr. Bush to support his campaign finance legislation in the Senate, where it commands majority support, and Mr. Bush ought to sign on to real reform. Americans want it. Most in Congress want it. Now even the donors want it. Mr. Bush and Mr. Lott should not stand in their way. 
2000/05/03	Aides to Gov. George W. Bush fought back today against accusations that his fiscal proposals are risky, saying that the growth in the economy over the past six months meant that there would be enough money to accommodate comfortably the governor's spending and tax cut proposals. Mr. Bush's advisers released a new analysis of his budget plans after days in which Vice President Al Gore has sharply criticized Mr. Bush on fiscal issues. Mr. Gore has asserted that Mr. Bush's large tax cut proposal and plan to push for a portion of Social Security payroll taxes to be put into private investment accounts would return the nation to the era of deficits. Mr. Gore went on an advertising offensive on Monday against Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, through a series of interviews and television appearances, charging that Mr. Bush would continue ''multitrillion-dollar debts.'' Campaigning today, Mr. Gore called Mr. Bush's Social Security proposal ''bad for America's future and bad for America's economy.'' The battle over numbers underscores how much the presidential campaign -- the first one waged in the new era of federal surpluses -- will be fought over economic policy and the related question of how to shore up Social Security. The Gore campaign considers the economic prosperity of the Clinton years one of its greatest assets. The figures released by Bush aides today addressed a weakness in earlier calculations. With the annual spending battle stepping up on Capitol Hill, the Bush campaign stopped assuming Congress would make large reductions in domestic spending, instead assuming discretionary domestic spending would grow. At the same time, Mr. Bush's advisers argued that the growth in the economy over the past six months means the federal surplus will be larger than previously forecast. They said that under their new calculations the estimated federal surplus across 10 years -- after $2.2 trillion is set aside for Social Security -- will amount to $1.8 trillion. That is roughly $1 trillion more than the Gore campaign estimates and about $500 billion more than the Bush campaign's earlier projections. Mr. Gore assumes a higher rate of spending and a less robust economy. Mr. Bush's aides said his cut would use 1.3 trillion surplus dollars, allowing $512 billion for other programs. ''The bottom line is clear,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the Bush campaign's chief economic adviser. ''Governor Bush's plan takes care of Social Security first, provides America's working families with a tax break and does it all within the context of a balanced budget.'' The Bush campaign's new calculations were released less than 24 hours after Mr. Gore's aides held their own session with reporters and released an array of numbers they said showed that to accommodate his tax cut, Mr. Bush either had to make ''cuts in core areas of government that are unimaginable'' or risk a return to deficits. Mr. Gore's aides were still critical of Mr. Bush today. ''Last month he claimed that his tax cut and spending increases were paid for,'' said Elaine Kamarck, policy adviser to Mr. Gore. ''Today, after finding more money, Bush still can't pay for his promises for a huge tax cut, increased spending and privatization of Social Security.'' The Gore campaign said Mr. Bush was underestimating spending, and Mr. Bush's advisers refused to disclose how much Mr. Bush's embrace of a national missile defense system and prescription drug program would cost, while saying the proposals fit in their spending plan. The most serious dispute between the two campaigns is the true cost of Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal. Mr. Bush's aides said the tax cut would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years from 2001-2010. Over just five years they said it would cost $460 billion, slightly less than their original estimate of $483 billion. And they pointed to an analysis from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation backing them. The committee is controlled by Republicans. The Gore campaign argued that it was more appropriate to examine the tax cut through 2011, since the tax cut does not go into effect until fiscal 2002. Mr. Gore's aides said that once that extra year is added in, as well as lost interest costs, the tax cut costs $2 trillion. Another looming battle is over debt reduction and Social Security. Mr. Gore has made eliminating the public debt the centerpiece of his economic agenda. He says that Mr. Bush's proposal for putting some Social Security money into individual retirement accounts will carry a huge cost because it will require using part of the federal surplus that would otherwise go toward eliminating the national debt. Mr. Bush's aides counter that by giving individual workers their own retirement accounts, which can be invested in financial markets, they decrease the government's long-term obligation to pay benefits out of tax revenues. This itself, they say, is a form of debt reduction. 
2000/05/03	Although Mr. Flake endorsed Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination in February, he has criticized the vice president's education policy, which opposes vouchers. Last October, Mr. Flake gave a warm introduction to George W. Bush, whom he referred to as ''my homeboy,'' at a meeting of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative advocacy group, at which Governor Bush outlined his education proposals. 
2000/05/03	It was not the spectacular golf course on a cove overlooking the Pacific Ocean that led Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania to fly here the other day to address a group of Republicans (though he did squeeze in a round before his speech). It was the chance to do something a politician rarely does: praise another politician more than himself. The object of his affection was Gov. George W. Bush. Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy, cut short a visit to India for meetings on nuclear proliferation last October so he could be in New Hampshire to toss questions at Vice President Al Gore in preparation for his first debate with Bill Bradley. After only 28 hours in India, Mr. Richardson rushed to London and then flew to Boston, where a waiting Gore aide frantically drove him to Hanover, N.H., just in time to catch the vice president in the parking lot. They are also seeking to score points with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore by stumping for them around the country, dispensing unsolicited political and policy tips and seizing every opportunity to say flattering things about their party's standard bearer. Mindful that they not appear unseemly, the one thing they dare not do is utter two words directly to the candidate: running mate. The Gore and Bush camps have only begun their painstaking hunts to find just the right running mate, and to resolve perhaps the one lingering mystery in the presidential sweepstakes before the national conventions in late summer. In recent days, Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, has been making the rounds, informing some politicians -- even some that others on the campaign said they did not consider hot prospects -- that they were in contention. Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state, is running the vice presidential screening process for Mr. Gore. The vice president turned to him because Mr. Christopher had the same job in 1992, when he helped Bill Clinton settle on Senator Gore. Mr. Bush has picked Dick Cheney, a former defense secretary and White House chief of staff who served under his father, to conduct his search. Since the Republican convention is first, Mr. Gore's choice may be in direct reaction to Mr. Bush's. For example, Gore advisers said that if Mr. Bush picks a woman, they might feel pressure to do the same. But Mr. Coelho said that because he and Mr. Gore know most of the contenders pretty well, one of Mr. Christopher's most important duties is to oversee background checks. Many Democrats say that Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts has been one of the most obvious practitioners of the subtle-but-aggressive approach. He traveled to early primary states to campaign for Mr. Gore and, the Gore campaign has noticed, has delivered speeches on national policy that helped raise his profile. On the Republican side, advisers to Elizabeth Dole made no secret of her desire to help Mr. Bush -- and get her name out. After ending her own bid for the Republican nomination, she frequently stumped for Mr. Bush in early primary states. And she has the added benefit that her husband, Bob Dole, trumpets her availability while she plays coy. Mr. Ridge is an obvious contender because he comes from a battleground state, has a compelling biography as a Vietnam veteran and is versed in national issues from his days in Congress. Most of all, he gets along well with Mr. Bush. To many Republicans, his biggest drawback is that he favors abortion rights, but that position could help Mr. Bush appeal to independents and other swing voters. In his appearance here before the Lincoln Club of Northern California, a group of moderate Republicans, Mr. Ridge, brimming with praise for Mr. Bush, spoke of the governor's ''candor, his mischievous humor, his directness, his decision-making ability.'' Mr. Ridge said the governor's ''compassionate conservative message makes a lot of sense.'' He defended Mr. Bush's controversial proposal to cut taxes by nearly half a trillion dollars, saying, ''I don't think Governor Bush should abandon his plan to cut taxes.'' After the event, Mr. Ridge insisted in an interview that he had been careful not to campaign to be picked as Mr. Bush's running mate. ''I don't think it's his style,'' Mr. Ridge said of Mr. Bush. ''I don't think it's appropriate. It's certainly not my style.'' 
2000/05/03	Vice President Al Gore, treading carefully, broke with the Clinton administration and also suggested that the case was best left to the courts. At stake is a crucial group of Cuban-American voters, which leans Republican but helped deliver Florida to President Clinton in 1996. Some analysts say Republicans were just trying to help George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, win Florida. ''Some would suggest that if Gore can deny Bush Florida, Gore would be hard to beat,'' said Brian Kennedy, a Republican political consultant. ''Republicans want to remind people that it was the Clinton administration that came in and pointed guns to take this boy back.'' 
2000/05/03	Gore Anticrime Proposal  Vice President Al Gore called for a broad array of anticrime measures, among them mandatory drug testing of all prisoners and parolees. His proposal would have the government spend $500 million a year to help states test, treat and counsel prisoners and parolees for drug use. Bush Aides Fight Back  Aides to Gov. George W. Bush disputed accusations by Vice President Al Gore that Mr. Bush's fiscal proposals were risky. They said economic growth in the last six months meant that there would be enough money to easily accommodate the governor's spending and tax cut proposals. 
2000/05/03	Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, could play a decisive role on the plan at the convention. But his campaign had no comment tonight, saying Mr. Bush looked forward to studying the report. On the Democratic side, the national committee's satisfaction with the existing system reflected the position of the campaign of Vice President Al Gore. 
2000/05/03	In a speech pungent with tough talk about criminals, drug abusers and his Republican rival for president, Vice President Al Gore called today for a broad array of anticrime measures, among them mandatory drug testing of all prisoners and parolees. Choosing a Southern state as the backdrop for one of his most conservative speeches of the presidential campaign, Mr. Gore proposed federal spending of $500 million a year  to help states test, treat and counsel  prisoners and parolees for drug use. ''When inmates are sent back to the streets unrehabilitated, unrepentant and unskilled, then they are just going to commit more crime and go right back into prison,'' Mr. Gore said to a crowd filled with uniformed police officers. As in all his recent policy speeches, the vice president used a harsh tone to attack Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the apparent Republican presidential nominee, this time maintaining that he had cut state financing of drug treatment by half. As a result of such policies, Mr. Gore said, Texas under Mr. Bush has experienced a 25 percent increase in the number of former inmates returned to prison for new crimes within three years of release. Mr. Gore did not suggest that Mr. Bush had been soft on crime, a position that would be hard to defend: in Mr. Bush's five and a half years as governor, Texas has undertaken the nation's largest prison-building program, executed a record number of criminals, lengthened sentences for many crimes and incarcerated a rising number of juveniles. But the vice president did say: ''I believe that we should demand that criminals get clean before they get out of jail. Governor Bush seems content to keep pushing them out of the same revolving door.'' Aides to Mr. Bush disputed Mr. Gore's statistic on Texas recidivism and his accusation that the governor had cut financing of drug treatment. They also said violent crime in the state had fallen 20 percent, to a 20-year low, during the Bush administration. And they asserted that the availability of drug treatment in federal prisons had declined during the Clinton-Gore administration, even as  drug use among adolescents had risen (an assertion disputed in turn by the Gore campaign). ''If Al Gore is willing to attack Texas, where violent crime is at a 20-year low and the largest prison drug-treatment program in the country is located, we're also expecting attacks on Texans for defending the Alamo,'' said Dan Bartlett, a Bush aide. Just as Mr. Bush has tried to move further to the center of the political spectrum with education and health care proposals, Mr. Gore's crime speech today provided him an opportunity to reach out to centrist Republicans and conservative Democrats. And he seized it with gusto. ''We can't go back to the finger-pointing and failed strategies that led to that steep increase in crime in the Bush-Quayle administration,'' he said. ''And we can't go back to the old Democratic approach, which was tough on the causes of crime but not tough enough on crime itself, again when people in both political parties wanted us to do more.'' Mr. Gore's effort to outflank Governor Bush on crime recalls Bill Clinton's drive in the 1992 campaign to neutralize what had been a potent Republican issue by advocating tough anticrime measures, including the death penalty. The vice president's speech today, typifying the administration's approach to policy making, offered a mixture of ideas -- some new, some old, many small-bore. Several of the ideas were first discussed by Mr. Gore in a crime speech last July in Boston, where he called for longer sentences for all crimes committed with guns and for requiring photo-bearing licenses for people who buy new handguns. Today Mr. Gore restated his support for a proposal that federal money help local governments hire 50,000 new police officers in the coming decade. The Clinton administration has already helped finance the hiring of 60,000 new police officers, with 40,000 more in the pipeline. Mr. Gore also proposed aid to help state and local governments buy computers for crime-fighting purposes, hire new prosecutors and expand after-school programs. Mr. Gore also jumped into what has become a contentious debate in Congress by endorsing a constitutional amendment to expand the rights of crime victims. The amendment would grant victims and their families the right to reasonable notice of court proceedings involving their cases, the right to have a voice in those proceedings, and the right to notice of an offender's release or escape from prison. 
2000/05/03	GOV. THOMPSON NAMED PLATFORM CHAIRMAN  Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin has been named chairman of the committee that will draft the Republican platform at the party's national convention this summer, an appointment that abortion rights advocates regard as a sign that George W. Bush, the presumed presidential nominee, will not ease the party's staunch anti-abortion position. Two years ago, Governor Thompson signed legislation outlawing the procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said the selection showed that Mr. Bush, despite his advocacy of inclusiveness, ''cares about what the far right of his party wants.'' Mr. Thompson said after his appointment on Monday that he looked forward to ''serving on the committee to articulate our party's most innovative ideas, the principles that bind us together and our vision for the future.'' BUSH HOLDS NARROW LEAD  The latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup presidential preference poll gives Gov. George W. Bush a five-point lead over Vice President Al Gore, 49 percent to 44 percent. The poll also indicates that should Mr. Bush pick Senator John McCain of Arizona as his running mate, he would widen his lead. Among all voters, the poll found, 2 of 3 would not be more inclined to vote for Mr. Bush if Mr. McCain were added to the ticket. But among independents, 2 of 5 said they would be more inclined to vote for Mr. Bush with Mr. McCain on the ticket. The poll, which surveyed 1,003 likely voters from April 28 to 30, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five points. In a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll taken three weeks earlier, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by nine points. 
2000/05/03	Two years ago, Homer Bush came off the Yankee bench with his awesome speed and he stole a few bases and won a few games. Now there is Clay Bellinger, whose strength is versatility. Joe Girardi was once the Yankees' backup catcher, and now the backups are Jim Leyritz and Turner. 
2000/05/03	HAMADA-Dorothy, nee Fleishman, of West Caldwell, N.J. on Monday, May 1st, age 91. Beloved wife of the late Joseph Hamada. Devoted mother of Roslyn Gore of Clifton, N.J and Edwin Hamada. Dear Sister of the late Rose Wenig and Bernard Fleishman. Loving grandmother of Ada (Kathy) Jill, Audrey, Jacobs (Sean), Wendy Gordon (Bradley), Matthew and Nikelle. Services at Jewish Memorial Chapel, 841 Allwood Rd., Clifton, N.J. today at 9:00am 
2000/05/04	Gore finds its justification only in what it adds to game play, and when the novelty of blood-spouting necks wore off, I found myself wishing this advanced damage model had served as inspiration for other elements of the game. The creators seem so taken with the depictions of violence that they have neglected the fear and dread that the carnage should inspire in its victims and perpetrators. 
2000/05/04	Gov. George W. Bush's plan to allow people to put their Social Security in the stock market (front page, May 1) is ill advised. I don't consider Social Security to be my main retirement income, but a fallback, in case the stock market doesn't do well. Mr. Bush seems to want to change my portfolio mix arbitrarily without my consent. He would be better advised to see to it that the current system stays in place. I want some of my retirement to be ''risk free.'' 
2000/05/04	He is also hoping to draw attention to Vice President Al Gore's education proposals while at least indirectly criticizing those of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican presidential nominee. Mr. Gore's battle against Mr. Bush is expected to be fierce in all four states that Mr. Clinton is visiting on this trip -- Mr. Bush recently ran an advertisement attacking the Clinton administration's education policies in Kentucky and Iowa. 
2000/05/04	I'm worried, though, about what this will do to Al Gore and George W. Bush. Now that the bar has been raised so high, America will be looking for a major laugh riot talent in the next president of the United States. Al Gore, on the other hand, while said to be a really amusing guy in person, is not wowing them so far -- though he has made himself more camera-ready with all that work on his pecs.
